				<p>Once upon a time there lived two happy friends, Tom and Jerry. Tom was a cat and Jerry was a mouse. Tom, with his masculinity, had a responsibility to provide security whilst Jerry, with his brain, made decisions. Not until they faced El Nino. Every food that they had was gone and now they were` only left with themselves. The next thing that comes in their minds was to hunt each other. Unfortunately, luck was not in favour of Jerry. Tom with his strength, had an advantage over Jerry.</p>
				<p>However, they both agreed to come up with all possible ideas that they could. The ideas that they formulated were:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="/go">Searchign for food</a></li>
					<li><a href="/fight">Hunt each other</a></li>
				</ul>
