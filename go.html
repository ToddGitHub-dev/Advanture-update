				<div id="script">
					<p>They both agreed that they will not tolerate 
						fighting and that this was a bad idea. They decided 
						to go and look for food. Some hundred miles away 
						from home they travelled. They were batteling with storms, 
						they flee from predators, they fought enemies and they travelled 
						unstopabbly towards the furtherest end of the world were there 
						was everything they they could ever have fantasised for.</p>
					<P>Under the palm tree, both of them were carried away with the beautiful
						melody produced from their ukulele. They ate as much as they wanted, 
						they swam as much as they wanted, they were enjoying themselves to the 
						fullest of their desire.
					</P>
					<p>"Jerry, wake up! You'll be late for classes", squeaked  Jerry's mom.</p>
					<p>It was Monday morning and Jerry cant wait to tell his friend of the 
						wanderful adventrous dream that he had about them. Quickly got 
						himself ready, he went to school.</p>
