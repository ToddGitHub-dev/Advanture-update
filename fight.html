					<p>"<em>Hunt each other</em> it is", cried Tom. </p>
					<p>Jerry was nervous about Tom’s intension. He was about 
						to protest but he realised that it was too late. 
						Tom had his claws out of his paws already, jumping 
						like a giant beast towards Jerry.</p> 
					<p>After some seconds, Jerry realised that he was running 
						away from a monster, once was a friend. With his clever 
						tricks, he fitted himself in a niche on a wooden wall that 
						Tom couldn’t reach and Tom and Jerry were never to be 
						friends again ever after.</p>
					<p>"Tom, wake up! You'll be late for church", howled  Tom's dad.</p>
					<p>It was Sunday morning and Tom cant wait to tell his friend of the 
						spooky adventrous dream that he had about them. Quickly got 
						himself ready, he went to school.</p>
